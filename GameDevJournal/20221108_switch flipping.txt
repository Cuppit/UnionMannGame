The problem today is how to handle the "interact" function.

Original idea: once the player comes within a certain distance
of an "interactable" object, a label pops up over it, indicating 
it can be interacted with.  Then, when the player presses 'e', 
the object will be interacted with.

BEST GODOT-STYLE SOLUTION: Create an Area2D around interactable 
object, so when player overlaps with it the label will pop up,
and interactions will be enabled.

UPDATE 0715: I've come up with a weird solution to enabling "interactors"
to interact with one another.  Once an "interacting" character (e.g.
a scene whose script contains the "interact()" function) enters the 
switch's "interact radius", the interactor receives a reference to 
the switch in a local variable.  Then, once the interactor uses it's
local "interact()" function, the "run_interaction()" function of 
the switch will be triggered.  I don't know if this is a good solution,
or if there's a much better solution to my approach.  I need to 
get some feedback from more experienced makers.

UPDATE, 0806: Fair amount of progress made, interaction hierarchy
has more or less been established.  Connections between switches and
triggered objects are managed by the "Main" scene script at initialization.
After that, specifics are dependent on the objects themselves, their
relative positions, etc.  Wish I had more time but it's time to go to
work.
