I spent the past 45 minutes playing with my work, and I got some basic functionality where a player can flip a switch to trigger activity in an object with which it's linked to.  Now to design some puzzles.

What we've created so far is basically "puzzle 1".  So let's go ahead and make puzzle 2.

PUZZLE 2: FLIP ALL THE SWITCHES TO OPEN THE DOOR

It will be hard to keep everything in one scene, so I will make individual puzzle rooms contained in nodes in the main script.  Out of time at the moment, have to be somewhere by 8 this morning.  Will continue around end of day
